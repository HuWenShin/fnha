## 📝 About

During the summer of 2024, we teamed up with the First Nations Health Authority to build a website to showcase First Nations-led Health Care Initiative’s (FNPCI) services provided in the First Nations-led Health Care Centres (FNPCC) throughout British Columbia.

We wanted to display health care information in a way that is culturally-relevant to the First Nations Community, so we chose warm color tones and nature elements to create a welcoming atmosphere and to represent the deep bond that the First Nations community have with their nature surroundings.

## 🦭 Features

We wanted to make the website fun and interactive, so we created a few points of interaction and animation throughout the website.

### Points of interaction

Each room on the map represents a service. Some selected service way points contain a carousels of graphic scenarios with hover cards for more information. Interact with the rooms and the graphic scenes to learn more about FNPCC services!

The soothing sway of the ocean waves and whales and orcas jumping in the sea, presenting to you the playful coastal vibes of BC 🌊
