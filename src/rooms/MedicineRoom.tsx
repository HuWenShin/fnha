                    The First Nations-led Primary Health Care Centreâ€‹ (FNPCCs) recognize the importance of mental, emotional, spiritual and physical facets of a healthy, well and balanced life. 
                    Use of herbs is an integral part of integrating Traditional medicine with western approach.  While the Medicine Room is a major client-facing facility, 
                    it is dedicated to storing and processing herbs that may be used by Traditional Healers or for smudging purposes.
