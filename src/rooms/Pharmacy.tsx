                    The First Nations-led Primary Health Care Centreâ€‹ (FNPCCs) recognize the importance of mental, emotional, spiritual and physical facets of a healthy, well and balanced life. 
                    Some FNPCCs may have on-premise pharmacies staffed by First Nations people to promote access to traditional medicine. 
                    Clients are advised to consult healthcare professionals for guidance on integrating traditional medicine with Western treatments.
